Each type of dementia may respond differently to specific medications, have a distinct progression and require tailored care approaches. For example, some medications beneficial for Alzheimer’s may have adverse effects in people with Lewy body dementia.

In Alzheimer’s, memory lapses are more frequent and progressive, especially affecting recent memory, with difficulty recalling recent conversations and events, frequent repetition of the same questions, trouble learning new information, and an increasing impact on daily activities.

However, advanced age alone does not cause the disease – about one-third of people over 85 do not develop Alzheimer’s.

For late-onset cases, the APOE-e4 gene increases the risk but does not guarantee that the disease will develop.

For example, carriers of the APOE-e4 gene may be more responsive to the benefits of physical exercise and a healthy diet, as well as to the detrimental effects of poor diet and sedentary lifestyle. This gene–environment interaction suggests that lifestyle interventions are important even for people with an increased genetic risk."

Alzheimer’s is a progressive neurodegenerative disease with specific pathological characteristics such as the accumulation of beta-amyloid and tau proteins in the brain."

                "answer": "Alzheimer’s typically begins with problems in recent memory and difficulty learning new information, while other types of dementia may begin with different symptoms: vascular dementia often presents first with planning and reasoning difficulties; frontotemporal dementia usually starts with personality and behavioral changes; and Lewy body dementia frequently begins with visual hallucinations and motor problems."

Each type of dementia may respond differently to specific medications, have a distinct progression and require tailored care approaches. For example, some medications beneficial for Alzheimer’s may have adverse effects in people with Lewy body dementia. Additionally, knowing the specific type of dementia helps in future planning and may allow participation in targeted clinical research."

In Alzheimer’s, memory lapses are more frequent and progressive, especially affecting recent memory, with difficulty recalling recent conversations and events, frequent repetition of the same questions, trouble learning new information, and an increasing impact on daily activities. Additionally, Alzheimer’s is characterized by greater temporal and spatial disorientation, planning difficulties, and behavioral changes."

However, advanced age alone does not cause the disease – about one-third of people over 85 do not develop Alzheimer’s. Normal brain aging differs from the pathological changes of Alzheimer’s, although both share some biological mechanisms such as inflammation and oxidative stress."

For late-onset cases, the APOE-e4 gene increases the risk but does not guarantee that the disease will develop. A positive family history increases the risk, but environmental and lifestyle factors may modify genetic expression."

The combination of these protective factors appears to have a greater synergistic effect than isolated interventions."

People with greater cognitive reserve may maintain normal functioning longer due to more efficient compensatory brain mechanisms."

For example, carriers of the APOE-e4 gene may be more responsive to the benefits of physical exercise and a healthy diet, as well as to the detrimental effects of poor diet and sedentary lifestyle. This gene–environment interaction suggests that lifestyle interventions are important even for people with an increased genetic risk."
